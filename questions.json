    "difficulty": "medium",
    "topic": "System Design",
    "solution": "```markdown\nPartitioning means splitting a large dataset into smaller chunks (partitions) distributed across multiple nodes so they can be processed in parallel. It improves scalability, query performance, and fault tolerance, since only the relevant partitions are scanned or recomputed. For example, partitioning a transactions table by date ensures queries only touch the needed time range instead of the whole dataset.\n```",

    "solution": "```markdown\nOLTP (Online Transaction Processing):\n- Designed for real-time transaction processing\n- Handles high volume of short, simple transactions\n- Optimized for INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations\n- Supports concurrent users\n- Examples: Banking systems, e-commerce platforms\n\nOLAP (Online Analytical Processing):\n- Designed for complex analytical queries\n- Handles large volumes of historical data\n- Optimized for SELECT operations and aggregations\n- Used for reporting and data analysis\n- Examples: Data warehouses, business intelligence tools\n\nKey differences:\n- OLTP focuses on transaction speed, OLAP focuses on query complexity\n- OLTP uses normalized schemas, OLAP often uses denormalized/star schemas\n- OLTP has frequent updates, OLAP has infrequent updates (batch loads)\n```",
