  "solution": "```markdown\nI tried to tackle this question dividing in two case:\n- Using dbt/sql. In this case I tried to talk about analyzing Joins, Order of execution between Joins, Where conditions and so on, possible use of CTE and window functions. Data cleaning and filtering, imputation and so on.\n- Using python. Understading if we need pandas, polars (parallelised) or Spark. And for each case again talked about filtering, imputing, loops/buidler patterns, memory management in case of distributed system. Partitioning and classical concepts.\n```",
